## A Dynamic Rubric Generator

Rgen is a computer program that provides a comprehensive rubric generator for
tests and assignments, combined with a course grade management system. The
feature set is based on my needs as an instructor at Mohawk College. Rgen
integrates data generated by several Mohawk College student data systems,
allows the dynamic construction of rubrics used for evaluation, generates
student grade overview reports with consistent comments, tracks student course
progress, and computes final grades.

1. Rubric Construction:
 * A rubric can be built before evaluation, or modified after student work has been graded.
 * Allows update of rubric comments, or comment scores during grading.
 * Comments can be edited to clarify, generalize, or fix mistakes.
 * Edited comments and scores are re-applied to all evaluations automatically.

2. Homework and Assignment Grading:
 * The generated rubric can immediately be used to grade homework submissions.
 * Grading and rubric generation are tightly integrated.
 * Grading homework, and evaluation design are presented as a unified task. 

3. Student Record Management:
 * Builds student record templates from FastSuite data. Name, e-mail, IDs etc. 
 * Imports grades generated by MyCanvas, on a per assignment basis.
 * Imports attendance records from online Zoom sessions.
 * Generates assignment, test comments and grade summaries.
 * Track special student issues, though extra notes system.

4. Supports Student Views and Faculty Views:
 * Additional notes are incorporated that are hidden from student views.
 * Hidden notes can be kept for both assignments, and student records.

5. Rgen is written in Python, is simple, portable and extendable.
 * Tool supports data import and export via plain text .csv files.
 * Import functions are simple and easily adaptable to other systems.
 * Interface is text based and menu driven, based on the curses library.
 * Grade reports can be printed, e-mailed, or pasted into existing LMS.

## Introduction

Rubrics are tools for grading student papers that facilitate generating
consistent grades, and minimizing the amount of time spent writing notes on
individual papers.

Ideally the instructor writes a list of goals to be met by a student
submission, and when grading tests or homework submissions the goals can be
used as a checklist. The core assumption of a rubric is that most students will
make similar mistakes, and it is helpful to write a detailed description of
common errors that can be given to students as part of providing feedback. The
rubric, might be implemented with a spread sheet or might be a checklist
printed on a sheet of paper, which is marked up by the instructor. Mohawk
College's LMS provides a static rubric system modeled on the classical notion
of a 2 dimensional scoring table. There are many good books on this subject,
see for example __Introduction to Rubrics__ by Stevens and Levi, 2005.  The
following rubric is taken from this book:

![Example Rubric, Stevens 2005](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/Stevens_Example_Rubric_p70.png)

When I started teaching at Mohawk College I tried to build rubrics with
spreadsheets by grading a few homework submissions to get a sense of what
students typically did, and then I would write out a checklist for each
question.  Problems arose when I tried to apply this early draft of my
checklist to the rest of the student submissions. I would notice patterns later
on that I hadn't imagined, or decide that a grade item that I believed would be
important, hardly ever came up. I would often rewrite the comment columns of my
rubric and then recopy them into the students answer sheets, or redo my initial
evaluations after having completely surveyed all the submissions. The process
was tedious and error prone.  

I also ran into some persistent bookkeeping problems. For each assignment I
needed to build a rather complicated multi-page spreadsheet that had each
student's name and id associated with each rubric. Individual students would
sometimes make special requests for extensions, or have other issues with their
submission that required some additional attention. Merging this data at the
end of a course was also time consuming. While a spreadsheet could nicely
handle addition, it didn't help much with file management, and I couldn't
figure out a good way to merge several multi-page spreadsheets automatically.

## RGEN Student-View, Final Report

Rgen's purpose to automatically generate a custom grade sheet for each student,
and merge those sheets into a single end of term report for the course.

The following table shows grades collected for the first term test for an
introductory course in computer programming. Each row in the table summarizes
the test results for a single student. This birds eye perspective shows per question
averages giving a detailed snapshot into the first term test for the course.

The table is also a menu, by highlighting a specific student the detailed
comments given for each question can be viewed.

![Example Student Grade Sheet](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_10.png)

The following grade sheet shows question scores and typical comments supplied
for an example student for the same test. In this test, questions 2 through 7
were automatically graded by the Mohawk College LMS MyCanvas, and these scores
were manually entered in to RGEN. Unfortunately MyCanvas has no way to export partial
test answers, so some manual data entry is necessary. The real work is saved in
generating comments for the long answer questions, and the grade tabulation.

![Example Student Grade Sheet](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_1.png)

Scores are tabulated in several ways, 2 are shown in the preceding example.  A
fixed value score can be entered, this strategy is used in questions 1 - 7.
Questions 8, 9 and 10 were scored by deducting points from a total. Each
deduction includes an explanatory comment. Rgen includes error checks that
prevent negative scores and prevent multiple contradictory fixed scores.
Rgen also support additive comments, where scoring starts at zero and each
comment adds points to the total. Mixing too many scoring strategies can
be confusing so this test does not illustrate the additive strategy.

While MyCanvas will not export grades on a per question basis it will export
full grade sheets. In the case of multiple choice quizzes which are
automatically graded within MyCanvas, these scores can be downloaded and merged
with other data collected by Rgen. The following view shows a partial grade
calculation which includes several course assignments, although the second term
test, final assignment and final exam have not yet been added to the totals. 

![Example Student Final Grade](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_9.png)

This kind of partial grade calculation can be very helpful when communicating
with students about their progress in the course. 

## RGEN Adding Comments

When grading a question, the instructor may choose to grade a single question
or a small group of questions in sequence for each student. The following menu
is used to provide comments and grades for a single question. The menu at the
top shows a list of comments and their associated scores which the instructor
may select from. Rgen computes the total score for the question as comments
are appended. In this example the student has made 3 common mistakes, and scores
5/10 total. 

![Example Student Evaluating Q](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_2.png)

The menu presents a list of 14 different possible comments.  Some comments have
fixed point values assigned to them, i.e.  "0   no answer" and "10    Good". Some
comments have no point value associated with them, others show -1, -2, or -4 and 
are meant to be selected in combination. 

## RGEN Modifying a Rubric

The Rubric editor is accessible from the question grading menu.

![Example Editing Rubric](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_3.png)

New comments can be added to the rubric, or existing comments can be modified at any point.

If an existing comment's score is modified and several students have received
the comment, the system will recalculate all grades. This can lead to some
surprising results. Rgen includes a check for question scores that go over the
maximum or under the minimum and will generate a warning until all scores fit
within the prescribed ranges.

![Example Editing Rubric](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_4.png)

Comment codes are exposed when grading student work, they include a decimal
point, "Q8.1", "Q8.2" etc., but are hidden in the student view.  Comments are
numbered internally in the order that they are created, but the order of
presentation can be modified by editing the rubric and moving comments either
up or down in the selection menus. In the above example comments are grouped by
type and severity. This makes finding a comment in a list easier. The same
order is generated in the student's version which can help with clarity, again
by keeping related remarks grouped.

## RGEN Searching for Students with particular Comments

An interesting feature provided by Rgen is the ability to search for students
who have received a particular comment. This gives the grader a simple way to
check consistency, or gain an understanding of who is struggling in the course
with a particular concept. The "Find" option can be run from either the grading
menu or the rubric editor menu. 

![Example Editing Rubric](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_5.png)

In the following search result, 4 students did not answer question #8. This
same group also did quite poorly on the test as this summary screen shows. The
first student "Be" asked to be excused from the test.  Question #99 is only
shown in the instructor's view and includes the '%' symbol hinting that this
student's grade will need special calculation at some point.  The others
struggled with the rest of the test, suggesting that question 8 was understood
by the majority of the group. Reviewing the detailed scores for student "Be"
will show the full remark under Q99.

![Example Search](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_6.png)

## RGEN Other Features

Rgen includes a collection of course management features. 

For quizzes, or assignments that are completely evaluated in myCanvas it is
possible to import grades for that assessment. MyCanvas will export the entire
grade sheet for a course. Rgen can construct an "imported" rubric that simply
shows final score. Unfortunately myCanvas will not export individual question
scores.

![Data Import](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_8.png)

Rgen computes a grade in progress for each student as well as adding up the
number of hours the student has attended Zoom lectures. Zoom has a feature
where it can require that students log in only with an e-mail address from a
specific domain. When that address is restricted to the mohawkcollege.ca
domain, Zoom's report can be downloaded and student's attendance records can be
matched via their e-mail addresses. While Mohawk College does not provide
credit for attendance, when discussing a student's progress it is helpful to
know whether they have been making an effort to participate in online Zoom
lectures, or not.

![Top Level Info](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_7.png)

Special notes are tracked with symbols in the last column. These notes can be
added to tests or to the root student record. A few symbols are built in with
various suggested meanings including '!', '\*', '%', and '?'. Keeping track of
who has made unusual requests, has missed an evaluation, or has a special
accommodation can be helpful as the course progresses.

From the top level student information view the individual student's detailed
records can be viewed. This same view will also show the details for any
special notes that are relevant to this student. This view can also be used to
drill down into the individual assignments and review or edit details.

## Anecdotal Conclusions

Prior to using this rubric generating tool I used a variety of different
grading strategies. 20 years ago when I was in graduate school the norm was to
sit down with a hardcopy stack of student assignments and write on each with a
red pen. I found this style of grading extremely difficult. I've only worked at the
college for a few years. During my first year at the I relearned how to use a
spreadsheet, following the lead of senior staff who would often communicate
grading templates in this format. MyCanvas, the learning management system used
by the college includes a static rubric system, although these must be set up
in advance of student submissions, and don't seem very flexible to me.

I wrote the initial version of Rgen in a few weeks at the start of the summer
semester and have been using it to evaluate student homework and test
submissions since then. With each homework assignment that I grade I find a few
bugs or limitations in Rgen that I fix. Generally I find that I grade and
return things much faster than I did in the past, and that the supplied
comments are far more detailed than I would normally be able to provide.
Students have not complained to me about their grades this term as much as in
the past. I'd like to think that the consistency of the remarks and the
detailed explanations contribute to better and clearer learning outcomes, and
generally happier students.

I occasionally suffer from wrist strain. It is an occupational hazard in
computing. I've spent time to optimize the menus in rgen to minimize key
strokes. While its still necessary to type in comments the first time, I find
its much easier to navigate simple menus with cursor keys than it is to scroll
through spreadsheet cells, and switch back and forth between a mouse and keyboard, 
or constantly retype remarks into spreadsheet cells.

## Bugs and Rough Edges

Some obvious features are missing. Initial setup requires the creation of a
special data directory. The .csv file downloaded from FastSuite must be copied
to a particular location and given a specific name, and the list of course
assignments, and their associated weights is assumed to be present. These
details require documentation and automation. There are a few ways that the
code can generate exceptions, although Rgen can be restarted in cases like this
without any data loss. 

Rgen is generally reliable, although there are no guarantees. Each time a
modification to either a rubric or a student's grade is made Rgen will save the
update to a .csv file on the disk. Very little state information is kept in
memory without saving it to disk. Performance concerns were ignored for the
sake of reliability. Rgen always makes a backup of any existing file prior to
performing a write and will generate an exception if anything goes wrong with
the write leaving the backup file in place. Rgen may destroy all of your
student grades and notes for a course. My personal file system is backed up
regularly, backups are essential when working with sensitive data, I recommend
the same for anyone using a computer.
