## A Dynamic Rubric Generator

Rgen is a computer program that provides a comprehensive rubric generator for
test and assignment evaluation, combined with a course grade management system.
The implementation is based on my needs as an instructor at Mohawk College. It
integrates data generated by several Mohawk College student data systems,
allows the dynamic construction of rubrics used for evaluation, generates
student grade overview reports with consistent comments, tracks student course
progress, and computes final grades.

1. Rubric Construction:
 * Rubric can be built before evaluation, or modified after comments are applied.
 * Allows modification of rubric comments, or comment scores during grading.
 * Comments can be edited after applied, to clarify, generalize, or fix mistakes.
 * Edited comments and scores are re-applied to all evaluations automatically.

2. Student Record Management:
 * Building student record templates from FastSuite, including e-mail addresses and student IDs.
 * Importing grades generated by MyCanvas, on a per assignment basis.
 * Importing attendance records from online Zoom sessions.
 * Maintains student e-mail list which can be used in any e-mail tool.
 * Generates assignment / test comments and grade summaries.
 * Generates grade reports calculating progress so far.

3. Supports Student Views and Faculty Views:
 * Additional notes are incorporated that are hidden from student views.
 * Provide support for homework and student record annotations.

4. Rgen is written in Python, is simple, portable and extendable.
 * Student data is stored in simple .csv files.
 * Tool supports data import via csv.
 * Interface is text based and menu driven, based on the curses library.
 * Import functions are simple and easily adaptable to other systems.
 * Export is done by cut-and-paste.
 * Grade reports can be printed, e-mailed, or pasted into existing learning management systems (LMS).


## Introduction

Using a Rubric as a tool for grading student papers has a few general purposes
including generating consistent grades, and minimizing the amount of time spent
writing notes on individual papers. Ideally the instructor writes a list of
goals to be met by a student submission, and when grading tests or homework
submissions the goals can be used as a checklist. The core assumption of a
rubric is that most students will make similar mistakes, and its helpful to
write a detailed description of common errors that can be returned as part of
providing feedback and evaluation. The grade sheet, or rubric, can be built
either from a spread sheet or might be a checklist on a sheet of paper that is
returned. Mohawk College's LMS provides a static rubric system modeled on the
classical notion of a 2 dimensional scoring system. There are many good books
on this subject, see for example __Introduction to Rubrics__ by Stevens and
Levi, 2005.  The following example rubric is taken from this book:

In my teaching of college student's I tried to apply this technique with
spreadsheets. I would grade a few homework answers to get a sense of what students
typically did, and then I would build a checklist for each question. Problems
arose when I tried to apply this early draft of my checklist to the rest of the
answers. I would notice patterns later on that I hadn't imagined, or decide that a grade item that I
believed would be important, hardly ever came up. 

I also ran into some persistent book-keeping problems. For each assignment I
needed to build a rather complicated multi-page spreadsheet that had each
student's name and id associated with each rubric. Individual students would
sometimes make special requests for extensions, or have other issues with their
submission that required some additional attention. Merging this data at the
end of a course was also time consuming. While a spreadsheet could nicely
handle addition, it didn't help much with data management or file management.

## RGEN Student View Report

The goal is to automatically generate a custom grade sheet for each student.
The following grade sheet was discussed in a recent lecture and used average
scores, and typical comments supplied for students. Questions 2 through 7 were
automatically graded by the LMS and these scores are copied in to RGEN.
Unfortunately myCanvas, the LMS currently in use by Mohawk College has no way
to export test answers, so multiple choice scores must be re-entered. The real
work is saved in the comments for the long answer questions which can be quite
complicated. 

![Example Student Grade Sheet](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_1.png)

Scores can be supplied in 3 formats, 2 are shown in the preceding example. A
fixed value score can be entered, this strategy is used in Q1 through Q7. Q8,
Q9 and Q10 deduct a fixed number of points from a total, assigning various
weights, and reasoning to each question.

When grading a question, the instructor may choose to grade a single question
or a small group of questions in sequence for each student. Grading groups of
similar questions helps to keep the details and related issues together. The
following menu is used to add comments to an individual question. The menu
at the top provides a list of comments and their associated scores which
the instructor may select from. The generator modifies the score for the
question as comments are added. In this example the student has made 3
common mistakes, and scores 5/10 total. 

![Example Student Evaluating Q](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_2.png)

In the above example the menu presents a list of 14 different possible
comments. Some comments have fixed point values assigned to them, i.e. 
"0 no answer" and "10 Good". Some comments have no point value associated with them.
For this particular test the course had 40 students, and the collection of 14
comments was developed while grading this question. For this question typically
students got between 1 and 4 comments. The question description includes a
reference to a lecture which discussed a similar problem.

The Rubric editor is accessible from the question grading menu.

New comments can be added to the rubric, or existing comments can be modified at any point.


If an existing comment's score is modified and many students have had that
comment applied already, the system will recalculate grades. This can lead to
some surprising results. Rgen includes a check for questions that go over the
maximum score for the question or under the minimum and will generate a warning
until scores fit within the prescribed maximum and minimums.

Comment's are numbered internally in the order that they are created, but the order of presentation
can be modified. In the above example comments are grouped by type and severity. This makes finding a comment in a list easier. The same order is generated in the student's version which can help with clarity.

A very useful feature provided by rgen is the ability to search for students who have received a particlar comment. This can help with providing consistency, or gaining an understanding of who is struggling in the course with a particular concept. In the following search result, 4 students did not answer question #8. This same group also did quite poorly on the test as this summary screen shows. The first student "Be" asked to be excused from the test. Question #99 is only shown in the instructor's view and includes the '%' symbol hinting that this student's grade will need special calculation at some point. The others struggled with the rest of the test
