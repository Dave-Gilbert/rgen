## A Dynamic Rubric Generator

Rgen is a computer program that provides a comprehensive and dynamic rubric
generator for tests and assignments, combined with a course grade management
system. Rgen tightly integrates Rubric design with assignment grading, allowing
the two tasks to procede iteratively. Rgen also integrates data generated by
several Mohawk College student data systems, generates student grade overview
reports with consistent comments, tracks student course progress, and computes
final grades.

**1. Rubric Construction**
  * Constructs a menu of comments with point values for each assignment question.
  * Point values can be fixed, partial additive, subractive or empty.
  * Rubric comments can be edited or reorganized to clarify evaluations.
  * Rubric design and homework evaluation are presented as a unified task. 

**2. Homework and Assignment Grading**
  * Homework scores and class averages are calculated as comments are applied.
  * Grading and rubric generation are tightly integrated, the workflow is bidirectional.
  * Edited comments and updated scores are re-applied to all evaluations automatically.

**3. Student Record Management, Tool Integration**
  * Builds student record templates from FastSuite data, including name, e-mail, student IDs etc. 
  * Imports grades generated by MyCanvas, on a per assignment basis.
  * Imports attendance records from online Zoom sessions.

**4. Supports Student Views and Faculty Views**
  * Additional notes are incorporated that are hidden from student views.
  * Hidden notes can be kept for both assignments, and student records.

**5. Rgen is written in Python, is simple, portable and extendable**
  * Tool supports data import and export via plain text .csv files.
  * User interface is portable, text based and menu driven.
  * Grade reports can be printed, e-mailed, or pasted into existing LMS.

## Introduction

Rubrics are tools for grading student papers that facilitate generating
consistent grades, and minimizing the amount of time spent writing notes on
individual papers.

Ideally the instructor writes a list of goals to be met by a student
submission, and when grading tests or homework submissions the goals can be
used as a checklist. The core assumption of a rubric is that most students will
make similar mistakes, and it is helpful to write a detailed description of
common errors that can be given to students as part of providing feedback. The
rubric might be implemented with a spread sheet or might be a checklist printed
on a sheet of paper, which is marked up by the instructor. Mohawk College's
Learning Management System (LMS) MyCanvas provides a static rubric tool
modeled on the classical notion of a 2 dimensional scoring table. There are
many good books on this subject, see for example __Introduction to Rubrics__ by
Stevens and Levi, 2005.  The following rubric is taken from this book:

![Example Rubric, Stevens 2005](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/Stevens_Example_Rubric_p70.png)

When I started teaching at Mohawk College I tried to build rubrics with
spreadsheets by grading a few homework submissions to get a sense of what
students typically did, and then I would write out a checklist for each
question.  Problems arose when I tried to apply this early draft of my
checklist to the rest of the student submissions. I would notice patterns later
on that I hadn't imagined, or decide that a grade item that I originally
believed would be important hardly ever came up. I would often rewrite the
comment columns of my spreadsheet based rubric when I was half done grading an
assignment and then recopy these columns into partially graded answer sheets. I
regularly regraded many of the submissions I looked at initially after having
completely surveyed all the submissions in an attempt to ensure that specific
comments were consistent. Sometimes one student would do something odd, I'd
make a comment on it, but then forget which student had written the unusual
answer and spend a lot of time looking for it. The process was tedious and
error prone.

I also ran into some persistent bookkeeping problems. For each assignment I
needed to build a rather complicated multi-page spreadsheet that had each
student's name and id associated with each rubric. Individual students would
sometimes make special requests for extensions, or have other issues with their
assignment that required some additional attention. Merging this data at the
end of a course was time consuming. While a spreadsheet could nicely handle
addition, it didn't help much with file management, and I couldn't figure out a
good way to merge several multi-page spreadsheets automatically.

After a while I realized that my primary frustration with grading student
papers was not really the volume of work, or the strange answers they sometimes
wrote, but it boiled down to too much fiddly number management, my inability to
efficiently keep track of all the small details, correctly sum long columns of
numbers, find notes, and odd comments. This was my motivation for developing
Rgen.

## Rgen Student-View, Final Report

Rgen's purpose is to build rubrics that can be easily used to grade homework,
and automatically generate a custom grade sheet for each student, and merge
those sheets into a single end of term report for the course.

The following table shows grades collected for the first term test for an
introductory course in computer programming. Each row in the table summarizes
the test results for a single student. Actual student names have been removed
from the screen-capture with a grey box. This birds eye perspective shows per
question averages giving a detailed snapshot into the first term test for the
course.

![Example Student Grade Sheet](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_10.png)

The table is also a menu. By highlighting a specific student the detailed
comments given for each question can be viewed.

The following grade sheet shows question scores and typical comments supplied
for an example student for the same test. In this test, questions 2 through 7
were automatically graded by the Mohawk College LMS MyCanvas, and these scores
were manually entered in to Rgen. Unfortunately MyCanvas has no way to export
partial test answers, so some manual data entry is necessary. Time is saved in
generating comments for the long answer questions, and the associated grade
tabulation.

![Example Student Grade Sheet](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_1.png)

Scores are calculated in several ways, 2 are shown in the preceding example.  A
fixed value score can be entered, this strategy is used in questions 1 - 7.
Questions 8, 9 and 10 were scored by deducting points from a total. Each
deduction includes an explanatory comment. Rgen includes error checks that
prevent negative scores and prevent multiple contradictory fixed scores.
Rgen also supports additive comments, where scoring starts at zero and each
comment adds points to the total.

While MyCanvas will not export comments grades on a per question basis it will
export summary data for all student evaluations. In the case of multiple choice
quizzes which are automatically graded within MyCanvas, these scores can be
downloaded and merged with other data collected by Rgen. The following view
shows a partial grade calculation for a student listing scores for the first
few assignments and the first test. The second term test, final assignment and
final exam have not yet been added to the totals. 

![Example Student Final Grade](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_9.png)

The student's grade is recorded as a fraction of the course work completed in
this view. Total Zoom attendance in hours is recorded as 0 for the example
student. Any special notes made on the student's work will also be displayed in
this view.

## Rgen Adding Comments

Starting from the top level student information view an instructor selects
"Enter Grades" from the horizontal menu and is presented with a table of tests
and assignments for the course and their associated weights. "T1" is the first
term test in the course. 

![Selecting a Term Test](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_12.png)

When grading a question, the instructor may choose to grade a single question
or a small group of questions in sequence for each student. The comma separated
list option will allow the selection of a small ordered subset of questions to
be graded for each student in sequence. Alternatively a single question at a
time can be selected. Question #8 is worth 10 points. It asked students to
write a short Python if ... elif ... else structure that converted a 3 letter
month to a yearly quarter, i.e. "Jan" -> "Q1", "Feb" -> "Q1", "Dec" -> "Q4".

![Selecting a Question to Grade](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_11.png)

The following menu is used to provide comments and grades for a single
question. The menu at the top shows a list of comments and their associated
scores which the instructor may select from. Rgen computes the total score for
the question as comments are appended. In this example the student has made 3
common mistakes, and scores 5/10 total. 

![Example Student Evaluating Q](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_2.png)

The menu presents a list of 14 different possible comments.  Some comments have
fixed point values assigned to them, i.e.  "0   no answer" and "10    Good". Some
comments have no point value associated with them, others show -1, -2, or -4 and 
are meant to be selected in combination. 

By selecting the "Next" menu option at the bottom of the comment list Rgen will
load the next student information table for the same question, and so on, until
the selected question has been graded for the entire class.

## Rgen Modifying a Rubric

The Rubric editor is accessible from the question grading menu.

![Example Editing Rubric](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_3.png)

Very experienced instructors may be quite good at anticipating common student
errors and able to write a complete rubric in advance of grading an assignment.
While Rgen supports this, its strength is that it allows quick access to the
rubric edit menu from the grading menu, and allows fluid development of the rubric.

The idea is that it should be easy to switch back and forth between adding
comments to student evaluations, and creating new comments for the rubric. Each
student may take a different and sometimes unexpected approach. Its often the
case that patterns in student understanding are revealed only during grading. 

If an existing comment's score is modified and several students have received
the comment, the system will recalculate all grades. Rgen includes a check for
question scores that go over the maximum or under the minimum and will generate
a warning until all scores fit within the prescribed ranges.

![Example Editing Rubric](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_4.png)

Comment codes are exposed when grading student work, they include the question
number and a decimal point followed by a comment number i.e.  "Q8.1", "Q8.2"
through "Q8.14" are visible in this example, but are hidden in the student
view. Internally, Rgen associates comment codes with student grade records, and
must merge the rubric with the student record each time it generates a student
grade report. This ensures that each student grade report will always use the
most recent version of the rubric when it is generated.

Comments are numbered internally in the order that they are created, but the
order of presentation can be modified by editing the rubric and moving comments
either up or down in the selection menus. In the above example comments are
grouped by type and severity. This makes finding a comment in a list easier.
The same order is generated in the student's version which can help with
clarity, again by keeping related remarks grouped.

![Preventing Deletion](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_13.png)

Comments can be removed from the Rubric only if they have not been applied to
any student's work. Rgen will issue a warning that shows the number of students
who received the comment.

## Rgen Searching for Students with particular Comments

An interesting feature provided by Rgen is the ability to search for students
who have received a particular comment. This gives the grader a simple way to
check consistency, or gain an understanding of who is struggling in the course
with a particular concept. The "Find" option can be run from either the grading
menu or the rubric editor menu. 

![Example Editing Rubric](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_5.png)

In the following search result, 4 students did not answer question #8. Full
names have been obfuscated with a grey box, leaving first two letters for
reference. This same group also did quite poorly on the test as this summary
screen shows. The first student "Be" asked to be excused from the test.
Question #99 is only shown in the instructor's view and includes the '%' symbol
hinting that this student's grade will need special calculation at some point.
Reviewing the detailed scores for student "Be" will show the full comment under
Q99, the symbol is a reminder of this student's special circumstances on this
test.

![Example Search](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_6.png)

## Rgen Other Features

Rgen includes a collection of course management features. 

For multiple choice only quizzes, or assignments that are evaluated
automatically by MyCanvas it is possible to import grades for that assessment.
MyCanvas will export the entire grade spreadsheet for a course in .csv format.
Rgen can construct an "imported" rubric, identifying the source file from which
grades were derived, that shows the final score recorded by MyCanvas.
Unfortunately MyCanvas will not export individual question scores, or
individual student answers. If you try Rgen, you are not locked in at any point.

![Data Import](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_8.png)

Rgen computes a grade in progress for each student as well as adding up the
number of hours the student has attended Zoom lectures. Zoom has a feature
where it can require that students log in only with an e-mail address from a
specific domain. When that address is restricted to the mohawkcollege.ca
domain, Zoom's report can be downloaded and student's attendance records can be
matched via their e-mail addresses. While Mohawk College does not provide
credit for attendance, when discussing a student's progress it is helpful to
know whether they have been making an effort to participate in online Zoom
lectures.

![Top Level Info](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_7.png)

Special notes are tracked with symbols in the last column. These notes can be
added to tests or to the root student record. A few symbols are built in with
various suggested meanings including '!', '\*', '%', and '?'. Keeping track of
who has made unusual requests, has missed an evaluation, or has a special
accommodation can be helpful as the course progresses.

From the top level student information view the individual student's detailed
records can be viewed. This same view will also show the details for any
special notes that are relevant to this student. This view can also be used to
drill down into the individual assignments and review or edit details.

## Anecdotal Conclusions

Prior to using this rubric generating tool I used a variety of different
grading strategies. 20 years ago when I was in graduate school the norm was to
sit down with a stack of student printed assignments and write on each with a
red pen. I found this style of grading extremely difficult. I've only worked at
the college for a few years. During my first year I relearned how to use a
spreadsheet, following the lead of senior staff who would often communicate
grading templates via spreadsheets. MyCanvas, the learning management system used
by the college includes a static rubric system, although these must be set up
in advance of student submissions, and don't seem very flexible to me.

I wrote the initial version of Rgen in a few weeks at the start of the summer
semester and have been using it to evaluate student homework and test
submissions since then. With each homework assignment that I grade I find a few
bugs or limitations in Rgen that I fix. Generally I find that I grade and
return things much faster than I did in the past, and that the supplied
comments are far more detailed than I would normally be able to provide.
Students have not complained to me about their grades this term as much as in
the past. I believe that the consistency of the remarks and the detailed
explanations contribute to better and clearer learning outcomes, and generally
happier students.

I occasionally suffer from wrist strain. It is an occupational hazard in
computing. I've spent time to optimize the menus in Rgen to minimize key
strokes. While its still necessary to type in comments the first time, I find
its much easier to navigate simple menus with cursor keys than it is to scroll
through spreadsheet cells, and switch back and forth between a mouse and keyboard, 
or constantly retype remarks into spreadsheet cells.

## Bugs and Rough Edges

Some obvious features are missing. Initial setup requires the creation of a
special data directory. The .csv file downloaded from FastSuite must be copied
to a particular location and given a specific name, and the list of course
assignments, and their associated weights is assumed to be present. These
details require documentation and automation. There are a few ways that the
code can generate exceptions, although Rgen can be restarted in cases like this
without any data loss. 

Rgen uses the curses library for character based screen management and has been
tested within a Linux bash environment. The curses library will normally be
pre-installed on any Unix installation but must be installed separately in
Windows. See:

![https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/](https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/)

At this time Rgen requires some work to read Windows paths properly. If there
is interest I'd be happy to look into it. Send me an e-mail if you'd like to
see Rgen tested and working on Windows and I'll find the time.

Rgen is generally reliable, although there are no guarantees. Each time a
modification to either a rubric or a student's grade is made Rgen will save the
update to a .csv file on the disk. Very little state information is kept in
memory without saving it to disk. Performance concerns were ignored for the
sake of reliability. Rgen always makes a backup of any existing file prior to
performing a write, and then removes the backup once the write has completed.
Any exception generated during the write should leave the backup file in
place. If a backup file is found prior to a write the system will flag the
inconsistency and request user intervention. Rgen may destroy all of your
student grades and notes for a course. My personal file system is backed up
regularly, backups are essential when working with sensitive data, I recommend
the same for anyone using a computer.
