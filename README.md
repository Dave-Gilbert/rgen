## A Dynamic Rubric Generator

Rgen is a computer program that provides a comprehensive rubric generator for
test and assignment evaluation, combined with a course grade management system.
The implementation is based on my needs as an instructor at Mohawk College. It
integrates data generated by several Mohawk College student data systems,
allows the dynamic construction of rubrics used for evaluation, generates
student grade overview reports with consistent comments, tracks student course
progress, and computes final grades.

1. Rubric Construction:
 * Rubric can be built before evaluation, or modified after comments are applied.
 * Allows modification of rubric comments, or comment scores during grading.
 * Comments can be edited after applied, to clarify, generalize, or fix mistakes.
 * Edited comments and scores are re-applied to all evaluations automatically.

2. Student Record Management:
 * Building student record templates from FastSuite, including e-mail addresses and student IDs.
 * Importing grades generated by MyCanvas, on a per assignment basis.
 * Importing attendance records from online Zoom sessions.
 * Maintains student e-mail list which can be used in any e-mail tool.
 * Generates assignment / test comments and grade summaries.
 * Generates grade reports calculating progress so far.

3. Supports Student Views and Faculty Views:
 * Additional notes are incorporated that are hidden from student views.
 * Provide support for homework and student record annotations.

4. Rgen is written in Python, is simple, portable and extendable.
 * Student data is stored in simple .csv files.
 * Tool supports data import via csv.
 * Interface is text based and menu driven, based on the curses library.
 * Import functions are simple and easily adaptable to other systems.
 * Export is done by cut-and-paste.
 * Grade reports can be printed, e-mailed, or pasted into existing learning management systems (LMS).


## Introduction

Using a Rubric as a tool for grading student papers has a few general purposes
including generating consistent grades, and minimizing the amount of time spent
writing notes on individual papers. Ideally the instructor writes a list of
goals to be met by a student submission, and when grading tests or homework
submissions the goals can be used as a checklist. The core assumption of a
rubric is that most students will make similar mistakes, and its helpful to
write a detailed description of common errors that can be returned as part of
providing feedback and evaluation. The grade sheet, or rubric, can be built
either from a spread sheet or might be a checklist on a sheet of paper that is
returned. Mohawk College's LMS provides a static rubric system modeled on the
classical notion of a 2 dimensional scoring system. There are many good books
on this subject, see for example __Introduction to Rubrics__ by Stevens and
Levi, 2005.  The following example rubric is taken from this book:

In my teaching of college student's I tried to apply this technique with
spreadsheets. I would grade a few homework answers to get a sense of what students
typically did, and then I would build a checklist for each question. Problems
arose when I tried to apply this early draft of my checklist to the rest of the
answers. I would notice patterns later on that I hadn't imagined, or decide that a grade item that I
believed would be important, hardly ever came up. 

I also ran into some persistent book-keeping problems. For each assignment I
needed to build a rather complicated multi-page spreadsheet that had each
student's name and id associated with each rubric. Individual students would
sometimes make special requests for extensions, or have other issues with their
submission that required some additional attention. Merging this data at the
end of a course was also time consuming. While a spreadsheet could nicely
handle addition, it didn't help much with data management or file management.
