## A Dynamic Rubric Generator

Rgen is a computer program that provides a comprehensive rubric generator for
tests and assignments, combined with a course grade management system. The
feature set is based on my needs as an instructor at Mohawk College. Rgen
integrates data generated by several Mohawk College student data systems,
allows the dynamic construction of rubrics used for evaluation, generates
student grade overview reports with consistent comments, tracks student course
progress, and computes final grades.

1. Rubric Construction:
 * A rubric can be built before evaluation, or modified after student work has been graded.
 * Allows update of rubric comments, or comment scores during grading.
 * Comments can be edited to clarify, generalize, or fix mistakes.
 * Edited comments and scores are re-applied to all evaluations automatically.

2. Student Record Management:
 * Builds student record templates from FastSuite data, including e-mail addresses and student IDs.
 * Imports grades generated by MyCanvas, on a per assignment basis.
 * Imports attendance records from online Zoom sessions.
 * Maintains student e-mail list which can be used in any e-mail tool.
 * Generates assignment, test comments and grade summaries.
 * Generates grade reports calculating progress so far.
 * Track special student issues, though extra notes system.

3. Supports Student Views and Faculty Views:
 * Additional notes are incorporated that are hidden from student views.
 * Hidden notes can be kept on both assignments, and student records.

4. Rgen is written in Python, is simple, portable and extendable.
 * Student data is stored in simple .csv files.
 * Tool supports data import via csv files.
 * Import functions are simple and easily adaptable to other systems.
 * Interface is text based and menu driven, based on the curses library.
 * Grade reports can be printed, e-mailed, or pasted into existing learning management systems (LMS).
 * Export is currently done by cut-and-paste.

## Introduction

Rubric are tools for grading student papers that facilitate generating
consistent grades, and minimizing the amount of time spent writing notes on individual papers.

Ideally the instructor writes a list of goals to be met by a student
submission, and when grading tests or homework submissions the goals can be
used as a checklist. The core assumption of a rubric is that most students will
make similar mistakes, and it is helpful to write a detailed description of
common errors that can be returned as part of providing feedback and
evaluation. The grade sheet, or rubric, might be implemented with a spread
sheet or might be a checklist on a sheet of paper that is returned to the
student. Mohawk College's LMS provides a static rubric system modeled on the
classical notion of a 2 dimensional scoring system. There are many good books
on this subject, see for example __Introduction to Rubrics__ by Stevens and
Levi, 2005.  The following example rubric is taken from this book:

![Example Rubric, Stevens 2005](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/Stevens_Example_Rubric_p70.png)

When I started teaching at the college I tried to build rubrics with
spreadsheets by grading a few homework answers to get a sense of what students
typically did, and then I would write out a checklist for each question.
Problems arose when I tried to apply this early draft of my checklist to the
rest of the answers. I would notice patterns later on that I hadn't imagined,
or decide that a grade item that I believed would be important, hardly ever
came up. I would often rewrite the comment columns of my rubric and then recopy
them into the students answer sheets. The process was tedious and error prone.  

I also ran into some persistent bookkeeping problems. For each assignment I
needed to build a rather complicated multi-page spreadsheet that had each
student's name and id associated with each rubric. Individual students would
sometimes make special requests for extensions, or have other issues with their
submission that required some additional attention. Merging this data at the
end of a course was also time consuming. While a spreadsheet could nicely
handle addition, it didn't help much with file management, and I couldn't
figure out a good way to merge several multi-page spreadsheets automatically.

## RGEN Student-View, Final Report

Rgen's purpose to automatically generate a custom grade sheet for each student, and merge those sheets into a single end of year report. 

The following grade sheet shows average scores and typical comments supplied
for students for the first term test in an introduction to programming couse.
In this test questions 2 through 7 were automatically graded by the Mohawk
College LMS myCanvas and these scores were copied in to RGEN.  Unfortunately
myCanvas has no way to export test answers, so multiple choice scores must be
re-entered. The real work is saved in the comments for the long answer
questions which can be quite complicated. 

![Example Student Grade Sheet](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_1.png)

Scores can be calculated in several ways, 2 are shown in the preceding example.
A fixed value score can be entered, this strategy is used in Q1 through Q7. Q8,
Q9 and Q10 deduct points from a total, assigning various weights, and reasoning
to each comment.

While myCanvas will not export grades on a per question basis it will export
full grade sheets. In the case of multiple choice quizzes which are
automatically graded within myCanvas, these scores can be downloaded and merged
with other data collected by Rgen. The following view shows a partial grade
calculation which includes several course assignments, although the second term
test, final assignment and final exam have not yet been added to the totals. 

![Example Student Final Grade](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_9.png)

This kind of partial grade calculation can be very helpful when communicating
with students about their progress in the course. 

## RGEN Adding Comments

When grading a question, the instructor may choose to grade a single question
or a small group of questions in sequence for each student. The following menu
is used to grade a question and provide notes for the student. The menu at the
top shows a list of comments and their associated scores which the instructor
may select from. Rgen computes the total score for the question as comments
are added. In this example the student has made 3 common mistakes, and scores
5/10 total. 

![Example Student Evaluating Q](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_2.png)

In this example the menu presents a list of 14 different possible comments.
Some comments have fixed point values assigned to them, i.e.  "0 no answer" and
"10 Good". Some comments have no point value associated with them, others show
-2, or -4 points. For this particular test the course had 40 students, and the
collection of 14 comments was developed while grading this question. For this
question typically students got between 1 and 4 comments, most comments were
reused multiple times.

## RGEN Modifying a Rubric

The Rubric editor is accessible from the question grading menu.

![Example Editing Rubric](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_3.png)

New comments can be added to the rubric, or existing comments can be modified at any point.

If an existing comment's score is modified and several students have had that
comment applied already, the system will recalculate all grades. This can lead
to some surprising results. Rgen includes a check for question scores that go
over the maximum or under the minimum and will generate a warning until scores
fit within the prescribed ranges.

![Example Editing Rubric](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_4.png)

Comment codes are exposed when grading student work, they are listed as "Q8.1",
"Q8.2" etc., but hidden in the student view.  Comments are numbered internally
in the order that they are created, but the order of presentation can be
modified by editing the rubric. In the above example comments are grouped by
type and severity. This makes finding a comment in a list easier. The same
order is generated in the student's version which can help with clarity, again
by keeping related remarks grouped.

## RGEN Searching for Students with particular Comments

A very useful feature provided by rgen is the ability to search for students
who have received a particular comment. This gives the grader a simple way to
check consistency, or gain an understanding of who is struggling in the course
with a particular concept. The "Find" option can be run from either the grading
menu or the rubric editor menu. 

![Example Editing Rubric](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_5.png)

In the following search result, 4 students did not answer question #8. This
same group also did quite poorly on the test as this summary screen shows. The
first student "Be" asked to be excused from the test.  Question #99 is only
shown in the instructor's view and includes the '%' symbol hinting that this
student's grade will need special calculation at some point.  The others
struggled with the rest of the test. Reviewing the detailed scores for student "Be" will
show the full remark under Q99.

## RGEN Other Features

Rgen includes a collection of top level features. It computes a grade in
progress for each student as well as adding up the number of hours the student
has attended Zoom lectures for. Zoom has a feature where it can require that
students log in only with an e-mail address from a specific domain. When that
address is restricted to the mohawkcollege.ca domain, Zoom's report can be
downloaded and student's attendance records can be matched via their e-mail
addresses. While Mohawk College does not provide credit for attendance, when
discussing their progress it is helpful to know whether they have been making
an effort to attend lectures, or not.

![Top Level Info](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_7.png)

Special notes are tracked with symbols in the last column. These notes can be
added to tests or to the root student record. A few symbols are built in with
various suggested meanings including '!', '\*', '%', and '?'. Keeping track of
who has made special requests, has missed an evaluation, or has made a
complaint about a grade can be helpful as the course progresses.

Rgen will compute partial grades based on the work that has been done so far.
The example student has scores for L1 - L7, T1 and Q1 - Q5. Several other
elements from the course have not yet been graded. The grading of T2 is in
progress for some students so shows up but isn't included. 

![Top Level Info](https://github.com/Dave-Gilbert/rgen/blob/main/images/RGEN_9.png)

For quizzes, or assessments that are completely evaluated in myCanvas it is
possible to import sets of grades. MyCanvas will export the entire grade sheet
for a course. Rgen can construct an "imported" rubric that simply shows final
single score. Unfortunately myCanvas will not export individual question
scores.

## Anecdotal Conclusions

Prior to using this rubric generating tool I used a variety of different 
grading strategies. 20 years ago when I was in graduate school the norm was to
sit down with a printed copy of a student's assignment and write on it with a
pen. I've only worked at the college for a few years. During my first year at
the college I relearned how to use a spreadsheet, following the lead of senior
staff who would often provide spreadsheets as a grading template. MyCanvas, the
learning management system provided by the college includes a static Rubric system,
although these must be set up in advance of student submissions, and don't seem
very flexible to me.

Rgen is fairly reliable. Each time a modification to either a rubric or a
student's grade is made Rgen will save the update to a .csv file on the disk.
It always makes a backup of any existing file prior to performing a write and
will generate an exception if anything goes wrong with the write leaving the
backup file in place. My personal file system is backed up regularly, backups
are essential when working with sensitive data.

I wrote the initial version of Rgen in a few weeks at the start of the summer
semester and have been using it to evaluate student homework and test
submissions. With each homework assignment that I grade I find a few bugs or
limitations. Generally I find that I grade and return things much faster, and
that the supplied comments are far more detailed than I would normally be able
to provide. Students have not complained to me about their grades this term as
much as in other courses. I'd like to think that the consistency of the remarks
and the detailed explanations contribute to better and clearer learning
outcomes, and generally happier students.

I occasionally suffer from wrist strain. It is an occupational hazard in
computing. I've spent time to optimize the menus in rgen to minimize key
strokes. While its still necessary to type in comments the first time, I find
its much easier to navigate simple menus with cursor keys than it is to scroll
through spreadsheet cells, and switch back and forth between a mouse and keyboard.

There are a few ways that the code can generate exceptions, these rough corners
need addressing. If you have any questions you can reach me via gmail at:
